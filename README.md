# Savings-Account-System-C

this is a c code which gets your information and creates your savings accounts where you can create new account, set password for your account, Check details of your account, Deposit and Withdraw money to and from your account respectively.

This code has been written by Pratyay Dhond(That's me!)

Thanks for checking out this code

So the goal of this purpose is to create a savings system where your money would be saved
I have used file management to store the data in the hard disk and then used it to access the files.

This is my first C project so if you have any queries or just want to chat(xD) drop me a mail at dhondpratyay@gmail.com
